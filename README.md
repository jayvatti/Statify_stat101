# Statify (for STAT 101)

## Introduction

Welcome to Statify, a personal project aimed at providing a comprehensive set of statistical functions and tools for Stat 101. This repository is currently a work in progress, and I plan to develop it further into a pip module in the future. Here, you will find a collection of functions that I have learned in my Statistics class and found useful. 

## Functions

### Probability Distributions

#### Normal Distribution

- **Normal CDF**: Compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a normal distribution.
- **Normal PDF**: Calculate the probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution.

#### Binomial Distribution

- **Binomial CDF**: Calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a binomial distribution.
- **Binomial PDF**: Compute the probability mass function (PMF) of a binomial distribution.

#### t-Distribution

- **t CDF**: Compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a t-distribution.
- **t PDF**: Calculate the probability density function (PDF) of a t-distribution.

### Inverse Functions

- **Inv Norm**: Calculate the inverse of the normal distribution.
- **Inv T**: Compute the inverse of the t-distribution.

### Regression Analysis

- **Linear Regression**: Perform linear regression analysis on a given dataset.

### Descriptive Statistics

- **Quartiles**: Calculate the quartiles of a dataset.
- **Five Value Summary**: Compute the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values of a dataset.

### Data Visualization

- **Histogram**: Generate a histogram to visualize the distribution of a dataset.
- **Scatter Plot**: Create a scatter plot to explore the relationship between two variables.
- **Dot Plot**: Generate a dot plot to visualize the distribution of a dataset.
- **Box-Whisker Plot**: Generate a box-whisker plot to visualize the distribution of a dataset.

### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

- **Anova Table**: Perform an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and generate an ANOVA table.

## Future Add Ons

In addition to the current functions, I have exciting plans for future expansions of Statify. Here are some features I am considering:

1. **One-sided and Two-sided Tests**: Include functions for conducting one-sided and two-sided hypothesis tests.
2. **Additional Probability Distributions**: Add support for Poisson, Hypergeometric, and other probability distributions.
3. **Archive Dumping**: Implement a feature to allow dumping and archiving of statistical data for future reference.
4. **Rejection Region and p-value Tests**: Develop functions for calculating rejection regions and p-values for hypothesis testing.
5. **Expected Value and Variance**: Include functions to calculate the expected value (E(x)) and variance (V(x)) for various probability distributions.
6. **Sampling**: Introduce functions for sampling from different distributions to facilitate simulation and inference.
